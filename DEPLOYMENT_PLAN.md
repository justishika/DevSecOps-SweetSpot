# SweetSpot Marketplace Deployment Plan

## Current Status
âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD working
âœ… Tests passing (11 tests across 3 suites)
âœ… Doppler environment management
âœ… Postman API testing

## Next Priority: DEPLOYMENT

### Recommended Platform: Railway
**Why Railway?**
- Full-stack app support (React + Express + MongoDB)
- Built-in database provisioning
- GitHub integration
- Environment variable management
- Auto-scaling

### Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

#### 1. Prepare Application for Production
```bash
# Add production start script to package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js",
  "build:prod": "npm run build"
}
```

#### 2. Set up Railway
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and initialize
railway login
railway init

# Link to GitHub repo
railway link

# Set up environment variables from Doppler
railway variables set MONGODB_URI=$DOPPLER_MONGODB_URI
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$DOPPLER_JWT_SECRET
```

#### 3. Configure GitHub Actions for Deployment
Add to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
```yaml
deploy:
  needs: [test, build]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Deploy to Railway
      uses: bervProject/railway-deploy@v1.0.0
      with:
        railway_token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
        service: sweetspot-marketplace
```

#### 4. Production Database Setup
- Configure MongoDB Atlas or Railway's built-in MongoDB
- Set up database backups
- Configure connection pooling

### Post-Deployment: Prometheus Setup
Once deployed, implement monitoring:
```yaml
# docker-compose.monitoring.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

### Success Metrics
- [ ] App deployed and accessible via public URL
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically on main branch push
- [ ] Production database connected and working
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] SSL certificate configured
- [ ] Domain configured (optional)

### Timeline
- **Day 1**: Railway setup and basic deployment
- **Day 2**: GitHub Actions deployment automation
- **Day 3**: Production database and environment config
- **Week 2**: Prometheus monitoring implementation

### Tools Priority Ranking Post-Deployment
1. ðŸ¥‡ **Prometheus** - Monitor the live application
2. ðŸ¥ˆ **Security scanning** - Snyk, OWASP ZAP
3. ðŸ¥‰ **Performance optimization** - New Relic, DataDog
4. **Advanced testing** - Cypress E2E tests
5. **Database monitoring** - MongoDB Compass, Atlas monitoring

### CircleCI Decision
Consider deprecating CircleCI since GitHub Actions provides:
- Same CI/CD capabilities
- Better GitHub integration
- Simpler configuration
- One less tool to maintain
